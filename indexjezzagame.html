<p class="intro">Ryan, a 22 year old boy from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, recently broke up with his love Jemma Tracey.<br>
    Heâ€™s not taking the breakdown of their six-year relationship not so well.<br>
    Jemma is coming over to his home, collecting her belongings.<br>
</p>
<p class="question one">The doorbell rings. It's Jenna, the horrible bitch. What do you do?</p>
<div class="firstQ ans">
    <p class="opendoor">You open the door and let her in</p>
    <p class="nothome wrong">You pretend you're not at home</p>
    <p class="daftcunt wrong">You open the door and yell at her that she is a daft cunt</p>
</div>

<p class="question two"> As soon as you let Jenna in she starts talking. <br>
    You can't listen to her, because her disgusting freckles are distracting you. <br>
    She is talking about her hamsters, which are still at your place. <br>
    She wants them back, are you going to give them to her?<br>
</p>
<div class="secondQ ans">
    <p class="givehamster">Ofcourse, those little creatures have done nothing wrong</p>
    <p class="ransome">Hell no, not unless that cunt pays a ransome for them.</p>
    <p class="alreadydead">They're already dead</p></div>

<p class="question three"> Jenna starts screaming, like a fishwife, and refuses to pay<br>
    You can feel the anger rising in your throat. Once more, you ask her to pay up!<br>
    Being the daft cunt that she is, she refuses you again. Now what? </p>
<div class="thirdQ ans">
    <p class="shove">You try to shove her outside</p>
    <p class="giveup">You give up, hand her the hamster</p>
    <p class="pickup">You pick up one of the hamsters and warn Jenna one last time</p></div>

<p class="question four">Jenna refuses again! You....</p>
<div class="fourthQ ans">
    <p class="cry">Break down and cry</p>
    <p class="beg">Beg for Jenna to come live with you again</p>
    <p class="hurl">HURL THE HAMSTER AGAINST THE WALL</p></div>

<button class="restart">Try again</button>
